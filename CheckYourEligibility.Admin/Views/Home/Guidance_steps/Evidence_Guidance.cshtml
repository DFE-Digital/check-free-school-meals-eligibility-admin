                    To find out if the children of a parent or guardian are entitled to free school meals, you’ll need to review the
                    supporting evidence they've provided.

                                To see if a parent or guardian can claim free school meals for their children, you must

                                In line with these checks, the annual net earned income of the parent or guardian must be no higher than

                                When checking an applicant with an asylum support reference number (formerly NASS number), a document
                                proving they are receiving relevant support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 is needed.
                                This may include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    a letter from the Home Office
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    a visa or student visa
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    other kinds of documentation, to be reviewed at your discretion
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                If the document provided demonstrates that they receive such support, this is sufficient evidence for them
                                to claim free school meals for their children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that some asylum seekers with a support reference number are claiming asylum under part IV of the
                                Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. These claimants are not eligible.

                                To see if a parent or guardian can claim free school meals for their children, check their Letter of
                                Entitlement from the Department for Work and Pensions. This will typically be a Pension Credit M1000 Award
                                Notice.
                            </p>

                                If the letter states they are currently in receipt of Pension Credit, they also count as being entitled to
                                free school meals.
